# LargeScaleApp
##Final Project for ECE 4574

Implements an Android app that allows users to control security settings for a simulated building environment. Users will log-in to the security system hosted on a third-party server for authentication (or registration if the user does not have a username). The simulated building is event-driven and will house robots, sensors, and personnel; this app will enable the user to modify settings for these robots and sensors, as well as the overall system itself.

## Features
* Create buildings with different security layouts
* Enable different security profiles for buildings
* Toggle a manual alarm to the security system
* Modify behavioral settings for robots
* Modify security settings for sensors
